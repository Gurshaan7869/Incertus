He asked me to introduce myself, and then asked me what are the things that I dislike. 2. Given an array with positive and negative integers, he asked me to print the Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm). In this, after writing the code on notepad, he asked me to dry run the code and explain how the code worked. 3. Find the unique number in an array consisting of duplicate numbers. I had to write the code for the same on notepad. Initially, I provided a naïve approach to solve this problem in O(n2) time complexity. The interviewer asked me to use another efficient approach and so I modified the code using HashMap. Further on, he asked to optimize the code again. Then, I provided the most efficient and optimal way of solving this problem using XOR operator. 4. He asked me to compare time complexity and space complexity of the aforementioned suggested approaches. 5. Next, he asked me a resume-based question. He asked me to talk about the Code for Good Hackathon that I had won this year and discussed about the problem statement that I was given. 6. Next, he asked me a scenario-based question. He asked me that if you are a manager, how would you manage employees who are highly skilled but are less participating in team work and are individualistic in nature. 7. Lastly, he asked me if I had any questions. I asked him some questions about Citi Bank.","tq2":"There was only one technical interview round.
